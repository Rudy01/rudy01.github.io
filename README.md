# C1_SAIC_InternProg
This is the project space for SAIC Interns

**This document will detail the implementation and usage for the intern dashboard project. This project uses Terraform to automatically provision CloudWatch alarms and dashboards for services in two different ways: either at the same time as AWS resources are being provisioned, or after the service’s resources have already been provisioned.**

# Usage
**Let’s walk through how to make an example service that uses each of our modules with a `dash_and_infra` implementation or a `dash_only` (and `infra_only` for testing purposes) implementation. Both of these examples can be found in the `examples` directory of the repo:**

**Note on shell scripts (`kube_config.sh` and `aws.sh`):**
Unfortunately, Terraform does not have support for all AWS API calls. If/when you encounter services (like EKS (kube_config.sh) or listing all available for certain services (aws.sh), there is usually an AWS CLI or kubectl command that will perform the same functionality. **Try to do as much as possible through terraform**, but know that you can do things through shell scripts if you need to.

`aws.sh` should be run **before** provisioning dash_only services. kube_config.sh should be run after provisioning dash_and_infra or infra_only services that require Kubernetes permissions/monitoring configuration.

:information_source: kube_config.sh does install the CloudWatch agent on your Kubernetes cluster

Simultaneous (`dash_and_infra` template, 2 EC2 instances, 3 server EC2 instances (2 used in containers), 2 lambda functions, 1 VPC, 4 subnets, 4 route tables, 2 NAT gateways, 1 security group, 1 ECS-EC2 task, 1 ECS-Fargate task, 1 ECS cluster, 1 EKS cluster, 1 EKS-Fargate profile, 1 EKS-EC2 node group, and 1 Elastic Beanstalk app (with 1 environment))
1. Let’s start by making a folder inside of the examples directory for our service and switch to it
   ```
   $ mkdir examples/simultaneous && cd $_
   --------------------
   c1_saic_internprog/
   ├── examples
   │   ├── simultaneous
   ```
2. Next, make the .tfvars file for this example
   ```
   $ echo > dash.tfvars
   --------------------
   c1_saic_internprog/
   ├── examples
   │   ├── simultaneous
   │   │   ├── hello_python.zip
   │   │   ├── hello_python_2.zip
   │   │   ├── simultaneous.tfvars
   ```
   :information_source:**Note: If you are creating lambda functions, you also need to add a .zip file of the code**
3. Change the values of simultaneous variables by opening the simultaneous.tfvars file
   ```
   ```
   Each of these variables controls a different aspect of our configuration. To see which variables control what aspect of the config, please view the inputs documentation for this template
4. Create a new workspace for this service in the `examples/templates/dash_and_infra folder`
   ```
   $ terraform workspace new simultaneous
   ```
   For more about terraform workspaces, please see [Workspaces | Terraform by HashiCorp](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/workspaces)
5. Create a Taskfile for the service
   ```
   ```
   For more info on the Taskfile, go to: [Home | Task](https://taskfile.dev/)
