# C1_SAIC_InternProg
This is the project space for SAIC Interns

**This document will detail the implementation and usage for the intern dashboard project. This project uses Terraform to automatically provision CloudWatch alarms and dashboards for services in two different ways: either at the same time as AWS resources are being provisioned, or after the serviceâ€™s resources have already been provisioned.**

:warning: **NOTE: DO NOT SWITCH WHICH TEMPLATE YOU USE FOR A SERVICE ONCE YOU HAVE PROVISIONED ITS DASHBOARD.**

**Terraform relies on a state file to keep track of the resources it manages, so if you switch from `dash_and_infra` to `dash_only` without removing your infrastructure from the state file, terraform will destroy your infrastructure.**

**Switching from `dash_only` to `dash_and_infra` is also not advised, since it can result in resource duplication unless you add all of your infrastructure to a .tfvars file and the state first (assuming that infrastructure is supported by our infra modules).**

**We have error handling in place to prevent swaps between templates for active services. If you would like to switch templates, please de-provision all managed resources before trying to run the service with a different template.**

# Usage
**Letâ€™s walk through how to make an example service that uses each of our modules with a `dash_and_infra` implementation or a `dash_only` (and `infra_only` for testing purposes) implementation. Both of these examples can be found in the `examples` directory of the repo:**

**Note on shell scripts (`kube_config.sh` and `aws.sh`):**
Unfortunately, Terraform does not have support for all AWS API calls. If/when you encounter services (like EKS (kube_config.sh) or listing all available for certain services (aws.sh), there is usually an AWS CLI or kubectl command that will perform the same functionality. **Try to do as much as possible through terraform**, but know that you can do things through shell scripts if you need to.

`aws.sh` should be run **before** provisioning dash_only services. kube_config.sh should be run after provisioning dash_and_infra or infra_only services that require Kubernetes permissions/monitoring configuration.

:information_source: kube_config.sh does install the [CloudWatch agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/deploy-container-insights-EKS.html) on your Kubernetes cluster

**Simultaneous (`dash_and_infra` template, 2 EC2 instances, 3 server EC2 instances (2 used in containers), 2 lambda functions, 1 VPC, 4 subnets, 4 route tables, 2 NAT gateways, 1 security group, 1 ECS-EC2 task, 1 ECS-Fargate task, 1 ECS cluster, 1 EKS cluster, 1 EKS-Fargate profile, 1 EKS-EC2 node group, and 1 Elastic Beanstalk app (with 1 environment))**
1. Letâ€™s start by making a folder inside of the examples directory for our service and switch to it
   ```
   $ mkdir examples/simultaneous && cd $_
   --------------------
   c1_saic_internprog/
   â”œâ”€â”€ examples
   â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ simultaneous
   ```
2. Next, make the .tfvars file for this example
   ```
   $ echo > dash.tfvars
   --------------------
   c1_saic_internprog/
   â”œâ”€â”€ examples
   â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ simultaneous
   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hello_python.zip
   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hello_python_2.zip
   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ simultaneous.tfvars
   ```
   :information_source: **Note: If you are creating lambda functions, you also need to add a .zip file of the code**
3. Change the values of simultaneous variables by opening the simultaneous.tfvars file

**Separate (`dash_only` template, 2 EC2 instances, 3 server EC2 instances (2 used in containers), 2 lambda functions, 1 VPC, 4 subnets, 4 route tables, 2 NAT gateways, 1 security group, 1 ECS-EC2 task, 1 ECS-Fargate task, 1 ECS cluster, 1 EKS cluster, 1 EKS-Fargate profile, 1 EKS-EC2 node group, and 1 Elastic Beanstalk app (with 1 environment). (`infra_only` files not shown, please go to our repo to see the .tfvars and Task commands associated with the underlying infrastructure)**
1. Letâ€™s start by making a folder inside of the `examples` directory for our service and switch to it
   ```
   $ mkdir examples/separate && cd $_
   --------------------
   c1_saic_internprog/
   â”œâ”€â”€ examples
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ separate

2. Next, make the necessary terraform files for this service
   ```
   $ echo > dash.tfvars
   --------------------
   c1_saic_internprog/
   â”œâ”€â”€ examples
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ separate
   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dash.tfvars
   ```
3. Change the values of separate variables by opening the separate.tfvars file
   ```
   service_name      = "separate"
   list_of_emails    = ["John.Doe@saic.com", "Jane.Doe@saic.com"]
   num_widgets       = 6

          - terraform destroy -auto-approve -var-file=../../separate/dash.tfvars  
    ```
  a. Each time you add a new service, you will need to:
    
     i. Add provisioning and deprovisioning tasks for the service (separate and destroy_separate)
    ii. Add those tasks to the global provisioning and deprovisioning tasks (services and destroy_services)
    
  b. For more info on the Taskfile, go to: [Home | Task](https://taskfile.dev/)
  
**From the home directory (C1_SAIC_InternProg) run the Taskfile with the following commands from the command line:**
1. Before provisioning any services, provision a remote backend: `$ task backend`
2. To deploy all services: `$ task services`
3. To run an individual service:

    a. **Simultaneous**: `$ task simultaneous`
  
    b. **Separate**: `$ task separate`
  
4. To destroy all services (and the backend): `$ task destroy_services`
5. To destroy an individual service:

    a. **Simultaneous: $ task destroy_simultaneous**
  
    b. **Separate: $ task destroy_separate**
  
    c. **Backend: $ task destroy_backend**
  
6. To test the services: `$ task test`

:information_source: When creating a test service for your code, make sure you provision a separate backend to prevent your other infrastructure from being influenced by the test. The terra_test.go file controls the testing example. Learn more about the Terratest package [here](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhHOW0EF5u8)

**We have provided testing examples that reflect our current implementations of each deployment. As services are added and changed, the .tfvars files for each of these implementations will need to be updated accordingly.**

**Testing**

All of our tests are written in Go using the [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/) package. Far more extensive documentation on everything that Terratest can do is available [here](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/docs/), but hereâ€™s what you need to know to get started:
```
import (
	"fmt"
	"testing"
	"time"

	http_helper "github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/http-helper"

	"github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/logger"

	"github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform"

	"github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/shell"
)

func TestDashAndInfra(t *testing.T) {
	// retryable errors in terraform testing.
	terraformOptions := terraform.WithDefaultRetryableErrors(t, &terraform.Options{
		TerraformDir: "../examples/templates/dash_and_infra", VarFiles: []string{"../../simultaneous/simultaneous.tfvars"},
	})

	defer terraform.Destroy(t, terraformOptions)

	terraform.Init(t, terraformOptions)
	terraform.WorkspaceSelectOrNew(t, terraformOptions, "simultaneous")
	terraform.Apply(t, terraformOptions)

	shell.RunCommandAndGetOutput(t, shell.Command{Command: "sh", Args: []string{"kube_config.sh"}, WorkingDir: "../examples/templates/dash_and_infra", Env: map[string]string{"": ""}, Logger: logger.New(nil)})

}
```
`terraform.WithDefaultRetryableErrors()` allows you to specify the `TerraformDir` youâ€™d like to operate out of and any VarFiles (.tfvars) that youâ€™d like to use

`defer terraform.Destroy()` makes sure that provisioned infrastructure is destroyed once the test ends

`terraform.Init()`, `terraform.WorkspaceSelectOrNew()`, and `terraform.Apply()` work the same way that the corresponding terraform CLI command does

`shell.RunCommandAndGetOutput()` runs a bash shell command and gets the output as a string

We recommend following [test-driven development](https://www.datree.io/resources/automated-testing-tools-for-infrastructure-as-code) best-practices and writing your Terratest tests first, then writing the module code that will succeed when run against those test examples.

# Known Issues
A list of known issues, errors, or improvements that need to be addressed in the future.
1. Trying to use multiple default subnets within a default VPC can cause errors or undesirable behavior. With the current implementation, you can only use multiple default subnets iteratively (`a, b, c` is OK, `a, c` is not). If you include the default subnet 3 times within a single `subnets[]` list of objects, you would get 3 different default subnets for services that require multi-subnet support (like `eks_cluster`).
2. Itâ€™s also possible to include an availability zone where there isnâ€™t a default subnet (`us-east-1b` in `us-east-1`, for example). Until module `precondition {}` support is added in Terraform, you will have to do some error catching on the subnets input using a `can(contains())` (or similar function) within each module
3. We specify a lot of `object()` or `list(object())` variables in Terraform. As of the [1.3.0 prerelease](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/releases/tag/v1.3.0-alpha20220803), there is planned support for `optional()` attributes within objects. **We would highly recommend implementing this feature as soon as it is released to the public, so that the user does not have to specify every single field within an object for each object.**
